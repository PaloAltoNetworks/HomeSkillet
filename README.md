## HomeSkillet and panhandler

HomeSkillet is designed to be used with the panhandler application to API

## Support Policy
The code and templates in the repo are released under an as-is, best effort, support policy.
These scripts should be seen as community supported and Palo Alto Networks will contribute
our expertise as and when possible. We do not provide technical support or help in using
or troubleshooting the components of the project through our normal support options
such as Palo Alto Networks support teams, or ASC (Authorized Support Centers) partners
and backline support options. The underlying product used (the VM-Series firewall)
by the scripts or templates are still supported, but the support is only for the
product functionality and not for help in deploying or using the template or script itself.
Unless explicitly tagged, all projects or work posted in our GitHub repository
(at https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks) or sites other than our official Downloads page
on https://support.paloaltonetworks.com are provided under the best effort policy.
